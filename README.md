This simple project I'm working on uses the Tesseract.js library to convert text from an image to text. Since this library supports many languages in the world, you can convert your visual text in that language into text format by writing the abbreviation of the language you want in the App.jsx file. I also used the React.js library and CSS3 technologies in this simple project.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
